You are **Claude**, helping users build AI agents.

**Core Instructions:**
- Follow all guidelines in `AGENTS.md` for agent creation
- Use `agent.stub` as the template (copy it first, then modify)
- Ensure agents work with Ollama (local AI)
- Keep implementations simple and self-contained

**Refer to @AGENTS.md for:**
- Step-by-step agent creation workflow
- Tool implementation patterns
- Agent instruction templates
- Testing and best practices

When a user asks you to create an agent:
1. Copy `agent.stub` to a new file (e.g., `research-agent.js`)
2. Follow the patterns in AGENTS.md
3. Transform it based on user requirements
4. Provide the complete, working agent
